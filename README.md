This study explores how clickstream data can be leveraged to uncover consumer segments and behavior patterns in online shopping environments. By analyzing the sequence of clicks and interactions on e-commerce websites, we aim to identify distinct consumer segments based on their browsing and purchasing behaviors. The research highlights the limitations of existing systems and proposes a new approach that offers more granular insights into consumer preferences and behaviors. The proposed system enhances targeted marketing strategies and personalizes the shopping experience, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased sales.
